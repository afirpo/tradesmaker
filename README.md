# Trades Maker
A plain &amp; simple mod for Captain of Industry to let you configure new Quick Trades.

Since I'm a very lazy person, you can find more info inside the 'Trades.xml' file that you HAVE to keep inside of the Mod's folder.
In fact, that file shall contains any piece of data that belongs to the creation of the new Quick Trades, village by village, one pair of Sell-Buy products at time.

<!--
Please note that:
 - 'defaultCooldownPerStep' is expressed in TICKS, not in SECONDS (I assume that ~1000 ticks = 1 second);
 - 'costMultiplierPerStep' and 'unityMultiplierPerStep' are doubles - you have to use the dot as decimal separator, as per Invariant Culture formatting;
 - 'cooldownPerStep', 'maxSteps', 'minReputationRequired', 'tradesPerStep' are all integers (no decimals!);
 - 'ignoreTradeMultipliers' is a boolean, but you have to use 1 for TRUE and whatever other value you want for FALSE;
 - all of those attributes of the root node are MANDATORY, because they are considered as defaults.
 
I don't really know what these values means, but I would like to give you the most degree of freedom as possible
just like if you're coding trades directly in C# - in fact, those are all [literally!] parameters
of 'QuickTradePairProto' class' constructor, no joke.

The numbers are directly taken from the quick trades, already in game, of the first Village (they are all the same for any trade).

	<!--
	The attribute 'village' is an integer representing which Village on the World Map would do the trade. 
	Of course, the Village number 1 is the settlement that is always visible since the game starts.
	This attribute is MANDATORY.
	You can add other 'trade' nodes, or use only some of them, from 1 to 5.
	-->
	<trade village="1">

		Note that:
		 - 'upointsPerTrade' is a double, and you'll have to use the '.' for separate decimals;
		 - 'buyQty', 'payQty' are integers (only X units of goods at time);
		 - 'cooldownPerStep', 'maxSteps', 'minReputationRequired', 'tradesPerStep' are also integers;
		 - 'costMultiplierPerStep', 'unityMultiplierPerStep' are doubles just like the Unity cost;
		 - 'ignoreTradeMultipliers' is 1 for TRUE and any other value for FALSE.
		 
		The full XML line to configure everything is as follows:
		
		 <quick productToBuy="" buyQty="" productToPayWith="" payQty="" upointsPerTrade="" maxSteps="" minReputationRequired="" tradesPerStep="" cooldownPerStep="" costMultiplierPerStep="" unityMultiplierPerStep="" ignoreTradeMultipliers="" />
		 
		Of course you can omit every attribute where you will want to use the default (=root node attributes) values EXCEPT for those MANDATORY attribs:
		 - 'productToBuy' (see the 'ProductIds.txt' file inside the mod folder for some ideas);
		 - 'productToPayWith' (as above, see that text file for reference);
		 - 'buyQty' from 0 to integer's max value, I suppose;
		 - 'payQty' just like the above attribute;
		 - 'upointsPerTrade' should range from 0 to double's max value, I guess.
		
		!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		!!! WARNING, PLEASE READ !!!
		!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		
		DO NOT remove Quick Trades that you had already used in any savegame.
		I mean that if you save a game where you trade, for instance, 1 Wood for 1 Coal, and then you delete this XML line, the game won't load!
		I'm tinkering out a solution (adding a logical flag "enabled/not enabled" won't works) but I cannot offer any warranty, sadly.
